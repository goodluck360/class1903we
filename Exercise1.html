     	On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the<br>
overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers,<br>
footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create <br>
pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look.<br>
     </p>
     <p>
     	You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by<br>
choosing a look for the selected text from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab.<br>
You can also format text directly by using the other controls on the Home tab. Most<br>
controls offer a choice of using the look from the current theme or using a format that<br>
you specify directly.

     </p>
     <br>
      To change the overall look of your document, choose new Theme elements on the <br>
Page Layout tab. To change the looks available in the Quick Style gallery, use the<br>
Change Current Quick Style Set command. Both the Themes gallery and the Quick  <br>
Styles gallery provide reset commands so that you can always restore the look of your<br>
document to the original contained in your current template.
